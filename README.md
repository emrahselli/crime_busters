Group 3: Project Proposal

Collect socioeconomic parameters such as unemployment rates, salary rates etc. and compare them with crime rates. 

We will create a multilayer geo-map that will toggle between unemployment, poverty rates and crime statistics for the city of Chicago. 

We will utilize Python API, HTML/CSS, JavaScript, postgress-SQL.

Our project will be a combination of web scraping and Plotly and/or Leaflet with Mapbox.

Our  project will include some level of user-driven interaction and will include a minimum of three views.
