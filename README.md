# crime_busters

We collected socioeconomic parameters such as unemployment rates, salary rates etc. and compare them with crime rates.

We scraped the data from Chicago Police Department Website and Chicago Data Portal using python, then cleaned, merged and load the data into an SQL database.

We created a multilayer geo-map that will toggle between unemployment, poverty rates and crime statistics for the city of Chicago.

We created interactive plotly bar and bubble charts.

We utilized Python API, HTML/CSS, JavaScript, postgres-SQL, GoogleMaps.
